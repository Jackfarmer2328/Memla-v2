# Public Proof Summary

This public repo keeps the proof story lightweight on purpose. The raw benchmark blobs are generated artifacts, not product source, so they are omitted from version control here.

You can regenerate fresh artifacts with:
- `memla coding benchmark-patch`
- `memla coding benchmark-compile`
- `memla coding benchmark-c2a`
- `memla coding extract-c2a`
- `memla coding distill-c2a`
- `memla math benchmark`
- `memla pack thesis`

## Coding

Primary bounded patch benchmark:

| Metric | Hosted `Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct` raw | Local `qwen3.5:9b + Memla` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apply rate | `0.0` | `1.0` |
| Semantic success | `0.0` | `1.0` |

Same-model control on the same OAuth slice:

| Metric | `qwen3.5:9b` raw | `qwen3.5:9b + Memla` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Apply rate | `0.0` | `1.0` |
| Semantic success | `0.0` | `0.6667` |

Additional support:
- earlier hosted upper rung: `meta/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` raw apply `0.0` -> local `qwen3.5:9b + Memla` apply `1.0`
- hosted `Grok-3` raw on the same OAuth slice: apply `0.0` -> `0.6667`, semantic success `0.0` -> `0.6667`
- second repo family against hosted `70b` raw: apply `0.0 -> 0.3333`
- second repo family against hosted `Grok-3` raw: apply `0.0 -> 0.5` on `2` completed FastAPI cases, with one raw-lane `HTTPError`
- earlier larger-local baseline: `qwen2.5:32b` raw apply `0.0` -> `qwen3.5:9b + Memla` apply `0.6667`

### Early self-transmutation signal

Pure coding C2A, same base model:

| Metric | Baseline `qwen3.5:9b + Memla` | `405b`-distilled `qwen3.5:9b + Memla` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C2A utility | `0.4908` | `0.5058` |

Repeated same-model validation after `405b`-only distillation:
- run 1: raw `0.2917`, Memla `0.5058`, index `1.734`
- run 2: raw `0.2767`, Memla `0.5058`, index `1.828`
- run 3: raw `0.3017`, Memla `0.5058`, index `1.6765`
- average Memla utility: `0.5058`, uplift over the earlier `0.4908` baseline: `+0.015`

## Math

Held-constant reranker benchmark:

| Metric | Raw | Memla |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `4b` ambiguous-step choice accuracy | `0.5455` | `1.0` |
| `9b` ambiguous-step choice accuracy | `0.4545` | `1.0` |

Harder end-to-end bounded math:

| Metric | Raw | Memla |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `4b` solve accuracy | `0.875` | `1.0` |
| `32b` raw solve accuracy | `1.0` | n/a |

## Honest claim

What this supports:
- Memla improves technical decision quality inside bounded executors.
- Smaller local models can behave like much larger raw models on verifier-backed slices.
- The same base model improves materially once the Memla runtime is added.
- Memla can begin to absorb useful C2A priors from a conquered upper-rung teacher and show a small repeated same-model gain.
- The coding wedge is real enough to package as a CLI.

What this does not claim:
- universal model parity
- `9b` beats `405b` at everything
- tiny models become frontier models everywhere
- one teacher pass is enough to solve self-improvement
